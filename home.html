    <h1>Early History</h1>
    <img style="float:right; margin-right: 34px; margin-top:20px;"src="NES.png" alt="A picture of the Nintendo Entertainment System" width=30%;>
    <p class="para">Let’s take a look at the early years of gaming, starting with the first games and consoles of course. The first gaming console ever created was the “Brown Box” created by Ralph Baer
      in 1967. This was a very primitive design compared to what we have now, it was a small brown box (you would assume so considering the name) and it would connect to a tv. The only games that were
      playable were ping pong otherwise known as “pong”, checkers and four sports games. A lot of people believe that the Atari was the first gaming console but they would be mistaken, the brown box
      was renamed “Magnavox Odyssey” in 1972 and released to the public just a few months before the Atari. A few years later the Magnavox Odyssey was discontinued but will always be remembered as the
      first home console. For a while, the Atari was the staple home console but that was soon about to change.</p>

    <p class="para">In 1983 a small company named Nintendo released what would be one of the most popular
         consoles in history and kickstarted gaming as a staple household activity. Originally known as the Famicom in Japan, it would take two years for the console to start being sold in the west,
         not by the name of Famicom though. In 1985 Nintendo launched the Nintendo Entertainment System (otherwise known as the NES) with a smashing success selling 62 million units throughout its
         lifetime. Along with this console came the original Super Mario Bros which was sold alongside the console launching Mario as their best-selling game. Alongside Mario, the console introduced
         many people to franchises such as Zelda, Samus and so much more. With the success of the NES Nintendo iterated on their ideas and later in 1990 realized the Super Nintendo Entertainment System
         (aka SNES) and continued selling more consoles as the years went on, some of the most popular ones were the Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii and Switch.</p>

    <p class="para">Nintendo was not the only company getting on the home console train though, in 1994 Sony Computer Entertainment would realize the PlayStation. The Playstation
      would be a direct competitor to SNES and later there would be a rivalrybetween Sony and Microsoft when the original Xbox was realized in 2001. To this day there is still a rivalry
       between Sony and Microsoft which results in console exclusive games and perks.

  <div  id= "Modern"class="home">
    <h1 >Modern Gaming</h1>
    <p>Since the early 2000s, the internet capabilities and processing power of consoles and computers have gone through the roof. Games are looking better than they ever have before even
       on small consoles like the Nintendo switch (Take Breath of the wild for example). Along with this new processing power came higher levels of storage for a cheaper price, this meant
        games could be digitally downloaded and stored on their respective hard drives. The need for game cartridges and disks was gone and things like the Nintendo E-Shop and the Xbox live
         store were becoming bigger and bigger. Big franchises like Call of Duty, League of Legends, Minecraft and Halo were taking over the market with ambitious multiplayer experiences.
          At this point, gaming was just as much a social hobby as it was a solo one.</p><p>Right now gaming has never been more immersive, consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series S and Nintendo
            Switch are providing people with more high-quality games than ever before. Not to mention the aspect of virtual reality gaming, VR is now becoming more accessible to everyday
             people as it has gotten significantly cheaper than even just 5 years ago. This has led to more developers making games that are compatible with VR or just straight out making
              VR games. Some of these games are breathtaking and not just because most of them are horror games. The amount of time and effort that goes into making a good game really shows
               in VR and I can’t wait to see what other things this genus of gaming hold in the future. </p>

  <div id="MobileGaming" class="part2">
    <BR>
    <h1>Mobile & Handheld Gaming</h1>
    <p class="para">Gaming is not only a home console adventure, in the late 90s and early 2000s Nintendo dominated the mobile gaming industry with its lineup of handheld consoles. From
      the original GameBoy to the DS all the way now to the Switch now, whenever you think of handled gaming Nintendo was the name. Sony did take a shot at mobile gaming to compete with
      Nintendo releasing the PSP in 2005 but sadly they stopped their efforts soon after. When you think of handheld gaming all these dedicated consoles come to mind but when most people
       don’t realize is the sheer amount of games that you can play on your phones. It is crazy how far the technology has come and how powerful modern phones are, you can play almost
       anything, people even port big PC games to phones like Five Nights At Freddy’s or even Genshin Impact. where ever you find a handheld device you'll find games nearby.
